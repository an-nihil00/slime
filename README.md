A hugo theme I wrote for [my site](https://xn--mp1a366c.xyz). Features include
- minimalist light-on-dark aesthetic
- proper use of html semantic tags (no `div` here)
- a configurable list of links at the bottom with fontawesome or forkawesome icons
- ability to tag posts or parts of posts as being in a different language than the overall site through the language frontmatter variable and the `{{< lang >}}` shortcode
- no javascript at all (though this does sacrifice the ability to have the site work on mobile, so I'm considering adding a little bit of script just for that)
