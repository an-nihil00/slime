A hugo theme I wrote for [my site](https://xn--mp1a366c.xyz). Features include
- minimalist light-on-dark aesthetic
- proper use of html semantic tags (no `div` here)
- a configurable list of links at the bottom with fontawesome or forkawesome icons
- ability to tag posts or parts of posts as being in a different language than the overall site through the language frontmatter variable and the `{{< lang >}}` shortcode
- no javascript at all (though this does sacrifice the ability to have the site work on mobile, so I'm considering adding a little bit of script just for that)
As mentioned above this project uses both forkawesome (for most icons I need for my site) and fontawesome (for 1 particular icon, forkawesome please add an icon for monero 😢), and in addition it uses the terminus-ttf font. I think everything i did with it is allowed under the SIL OFL, but if the creator finds that something is wrong please let me know, I appreciate you making it so I was able to use my favorite monospace font on my site 💕
